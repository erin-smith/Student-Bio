          Greetings! I hail from Tulsa, Oklahoma- the heart of "Tornado Alley". 
          However, I consider San Diego my home, and can't see myself moving. 
          Currently I manage a coffee shop, and by trade I've been a caf√©/restaurant manager for the last 15 years.
    </p>
        <p>A musician and writer at heart, I play 3 instruments and I sing. 
          I was in the UCSD Symphony Chorus until COVID-19 struck the planet! 
          We were going to perform "War Requiem, Op.66" by Benjamin Britten. 
          It's in Latin with beautiful dissonance and whole tone scales and was composed in response to WWII. 
          I love to write poetry/prose and attend local writer's groups. Publishing a novel is on my "bucket-list".
    </p>
       <p>
          My secret talent is finding lost things/solving-puzzles. 
          I obsess over languages- this includes computers, math, and art. 
          Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS are fascinating to me but I have a LOT to learn! 
          I want to see my career take off locally in the Tech world in the next few years. 
          I am not sure what exactly that looks like yet; but I will figure it out! 
          I'm ready to put in the work and change my future for the better.
       </p>
